## About me

Passionate full-stack developer with strong problem-solving skills and a commitment to building scalable, high-impact applications.
I love **creating** — from crafting interactive dashboards and intuitive interfaces to engineering reliable backend systems that bring ideas to life.
Skilled in collaborative development, effective communication, and continuous learning, I thrive in agile environments where innovation, quality, and teamwork drive success.
Always curious and hands-on, I aim to grow both as a technical expert and as a mentor, contributing to meaningful, creative projects that make a difference.
